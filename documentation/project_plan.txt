ALGORITHMIC PLAN
----------------
* car physics (most complex)
 - update car position based on angle and acceleration
 - object collision: 
    - find point of intersection and use the tangent of that
      point as the line of reflection
    - use Phong's Reflection Model to calculate new x and y velocities

enemy ai
 - checkpoints along the track
 - enemy cars calculate possible future positions after left/right turn
   and make turn if it places the car closer to the next checkpoint

win condition
 - car finishes race after completing certain amount of laps
